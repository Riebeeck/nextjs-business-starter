### 3. ✅ Tabbed Carousel Component

**Created `components/ProjectTabs.tsx`:**
- Client component with interactive tab navigation
- Inspired by Astronomer's design
- 5 project categories:
  1. **AI** - AI & LLM Workflows
  2. **Data Engineering** - Scalable Data Pipelines
  3. **Machine Learning** - ML Operations
  4. **DevOps** - Infrastructure Automation
  5. **Analytics** - Analytics & Reporting

**Features:**
- Smooth tab transitions
- Category-based project filtering
- Placeholder content for empty categories with:
  - Category icon
  - Descriptive title
  - Explanation of category focus
  - "Coming soon" message
- Responsive design with horizontal scroll on mobile
- Hover effects on tabs and project cards

**Design Elements:**
- Clean tab navigation with bottom border indicator
- Active tab highlighted with dark border
- Grid layout for project cards (1/2/3 columns responsive)
- Consistent with minimalist design system

### 4. ✅ Projects Page Redesign

**Updated `app/projects/page.tsx`:**
- Integrated `ProjectTabs` component
- Updated header with professional description
- Changed from grid view to tabbed interface
- Added category-focused description
- Increased max-width to accommodate tabs

**New Description:**
> "Explore my work across data engineering, machine learning, AI, DevOps, and analytics. From scalable data pipelines to ML operations and infrastructure automation."

### 5. ✅ Project Categorization

**Updated Project Files:**
- Added category tags to `technologies` array
- `portfolio-website.mdx`: Added `"data-engineering"` tag
- `task-management-app.mdx`: Added `"devops"` tag

**Category Mapping:**
Projects are filtered by checking if their `technologies` array includes category-related keywords:
- AI → "ai"
- Data Engineering → "data-engineering"
- Machine Learning → "machine-learning"
- DevOps → "devops"
- Analytics → "analytics"

## Technical Implementation

### Tab Component Architecture

```typescript
// components/ProjectTabs.tsx
'use client';

- State management with useState for active tab
- Dynamic filtering based on selected category
- Placeholder content for empty categories
- Responsive tab navigation
- Grid layout for project cards
```

### Category Filtering Logic

```typescript
const getProjectsByCategory = (category: Category) => {
  return projects.filter((project) =>
    project.technologies?.some((tech) =>
      tech.toLowerCase().includes(category.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '-'))
    )
  );
};
```

### Placeholder Content

Each category has predefined placeholder content when no projects exist:
- Icon emoji
- Category title
- Description of category focus
- "Coming soon" message

## Design Inspiration from Astronomer

**Borrowed Elements:**
1. **Tab Navigation** - Clean, minimal tab design with bottom border
2. **Category Organization** - Similar categories (AI, Data Engineering, ML, DevOps, Analytics)
3. **Content Switching** - Smooth transitions between categories
4. **Professional Aesthetic** - Minimal, clean, business-focused design

**Adapted for Portfolio:**
- Simplified to single-row tabs
- Added placeholder content for empty categories
- Integrated with existing project card design
- Maintained minimalist color palette

## Build Results
