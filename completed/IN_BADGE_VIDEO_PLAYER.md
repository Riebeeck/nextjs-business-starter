# In-Badge Video Player - Complete

## Overview
Updated the team member profile to play the introduction video directly within the circular badge instead of opening a modal. The badge now shows your profile photo as a thumbnail and plays the video in-place when clicked.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Video Plays Within Badge**
**Before:** Clicking opened a full-screen modal
**After:** Video plays directly in the circular badge

### 2. **Profile Photo Thumbnail**
- Shows your actual profile photo before playing
- Image: `/images/general/IMG_2574 (1).JPG`
- Perfectly cropped to circular badge
- Uses Next.js Image optimization

### 3. **Interactive States**

#### **Default State (Not Playing)**
- Profile photo visible
- Play icon badge in bottom-right corner
- Hover shows play button overlay

#### **Playing State**
- Video plays within the circular badge
- Video is muted (autoplay requirement)
- Hover shows pause button overlay
- Play badge disappears during playback

#### **After Video Ends**
- Automatically returns to profile photo
- Video resets to beginning
- Ready to play again

### 4. **User Interactions**

**Click to Play:**
- Click badge → Video starts playing
- Profile photo fades out
- Video appears in same circular space

**Click to Pause:**
- Click while playing → Video pauses
- Returns to profile photo thumbnail

**Auto-Reset:**
- Video ends → Returns to profile photo
- Ready for next play

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
<div className="w-32 h-32 rounded-full overflow-hidden">
  {/* Video element (always present, hidden when not playing) */}
  <video ref={videoRef} />
  
  {/* Profile photo (visible when not playing) */}
  {!isPlaying && <Image src={profilePhoto} />}
  
  {/* Play/Pause overlay */}
  {!isPlaying ? <PlayIcon /> : <PauseIcon />}
  
  {/* Play badge indicator */}
  {!isPlaying && <PlayBadge />}
</div>
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);

// Toggle play/pause
const handleClick = () => {
  if (isPlaying) {
    videoRef.current?.pause();
    setIsPlaying(false);
  } else {
    videoRef.current?.play();
    setIsPlaying(true);
  }
};

// Reset when video ends
const handleVideoEnd = () => {
  setIsPlaying(false);
  videoRef.current.currentTime = 0;
};
```
