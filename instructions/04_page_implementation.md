# Phase 4: Page Implementation

Implement all pages for the portfolio website.

## Pages to Create:

### 1. Homepage (`app/page.tsx`):
- Hero section with compelling bio (2-3 sentences)
- "Recent Posts" section showing 3 most recent blog posts
- "Featured Projects" section showing 3 featured projects
- Each card should be clickable and link to the full content
- Use grid layout for projects, list for blog posts
- Add proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### 2. About Page (`app/about/page.tsx`):
- Static page with placeholder content
- Professional bio section
- Skills/technologies section
- Experience timeline (optional)
- Make it easy to customize later

### 3. Blog Archive (`app/blog/page.tsx`):
- List all blog posts sorted by date (newest first)
- Show title, date, summary for each post
- Make titles clickable linking to /blog/[slug]
- Add subtle hover effects
- Responsive grid or list layout

### 4. Single Blog Post (`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`):
- Dynamic route that renders MDX content
- Display title, date, author at the top
- Render MDX with styled components
- Beautiful typography for reading
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Generate dynamic metadata for SEO

### 5. Projects Archive (`app/projects/page.tsx`):
- Grid layout (2-3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Project cards with image, title, summary
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Link to individual project pages

### 6. Single Project (`app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`):
- Similar to blog post template
- Display project details and full description
- Technology stack badges/tags
- Links to live demo and GitHub repo (if in frontmatter)
- Generate dynamic metadata for SEO
