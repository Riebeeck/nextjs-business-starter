# Media Example

This is an example blog post showing how to use different types of media in your content.

## Using Images

You can add images using standard Markdown syntax. The image will automatically be optimized by Next.js and display with a caption:

![Example screenshot showing a beautiful dashboard](/images/projects/dashboard-screenshot.png)

Images are automatically:
- Optimized for performance
- Responsive across devices
- Displayed with captions (using the alt text)
- Lazy loaded for better performance

## Using Local Videos

For short demo videos (under 2 minutes), you can host them locally:

<video src="/videos/demos/product-demo.mp4" controls />

You can also add video attributes:

<video 
  src="/videos/demos/background-animation.mp4" 
  autoPlay 
  loop 
  muted 
/>

## Using YouTube Videos

For longer videos or to save bandwidth, embed YouTube videos:

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Example Tutorial Video" />

## Multiple Images

You can add multiple images in a row:

![First image](/images/blog/image-1.jpg)

![Second image](/images/blog/image-2.jpg)

![Third image](/images/blog/image-3.jpg)

## Best Practices

1. **Always optimize images** before adding them to your project
2. **Use descriptive alt text** for accessibility
3. **Keep videos short** (< 2 minutes) or use YouTube
4. **Compress videos** to reasonable file sizes (< 50MB)
5. **Use WebP format** for images when possible

## Conclusion

Now you know how to add rich media to your blog posts and project pages!
