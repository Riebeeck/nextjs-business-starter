# Welcome to Your Blog

This is an example blog post to help you get started with your new Next.js blog. Feel free to delete this post and create your own content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components directly in your blog posts, making them interactive and dynamic.

```jsx
import { CustomComponent } from '@/components/CustomComponent';

<CustomComponent prop="value" />
```

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/blog/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, summary, author, and tags
3. Write your content using Markdown
4. Use React components when needed for interactivity

### Frontmatter Example

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-15"
summary: "A brief description of your post"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
---
```

## Markdown Features

You have access to all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Inline code`
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

### Images

Add images using standard Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/blog/your-image.jpg)
```

### Lists

Ordered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Code Syntax Highlighting

This template uses Shiki for beautiful syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  summary: string;
  author: string;
  tags: string[];
}

export async function getBlogPost(slug: string): Promise<BlogPost> {
  const post = await fetch(`/api/posts/${slug}`);
  return post.json();
}
```

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple Python function"""
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

## Next Steps

1. **Delete this example post** - Remove this file when you're ready
2. **Create your own content** - Write about topics you're passionate about
3. **Customize the design** - Adjust styles in the theme system
4. **Add more features** - Extend the blog with comments, search, etc.
