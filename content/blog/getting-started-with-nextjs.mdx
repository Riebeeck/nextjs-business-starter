# Getting Started with Next.js 15 and the App Router

Next.js 15 represents a significant leap forward in React-based web development. With the introduction of the App Router and React Server Components, building performant, scalable applications has never been easier.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for React applications, and for good reason:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improved SEO and initial page load
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Lightning-fast pages
- **API Routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend
- **File-based Routing** - Intuitive and powerful routing system
- **Automatic Code Splitting** - Optimized bundle sizes

## The App Router: A New Paradigm

The App Router introduces a new way of thinking about React applications. Instead of the traditional Pages Router, we now have:

### Server Components by Default

```typescript
// This is a Server Component by default
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Server Components run on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. This results in:

1. **Faster initial page loads**
2. **Better SEO** - Content is rendered on the server
3. **Reduced bundle size** - Less JavaScript to download
4. **Direct database access** - No need for API routes

### Client Components When Needed

For interactivity, we use Client Components:

```typescript
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Layouts

Layouts allow you to share UI between routes:

```typescript
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Header />
        <main>{children}</main>
        <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 2. Loading States

Create instant loading states with `loading.tsx`:

```typescript
export default function Loading() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

### 3. Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully with `error.tsx`:

```typescript
'use client';

export default function Error({ error, reset }: { error: Error; reset: () => void }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when you need interactivity
2. **Leverage async/await** - Fetch data directly in Server Components
3. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Use error.tsx for graceful error handling
4. **Optimize images** - Always use next/image for automatic optimization
5. **Use TypeScript** - Type safety prevents bugs and improves developer experience

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 with the App Router represents the future of React development. By embracing Server Components and following best practices, you can build applications that are faster, more maintainable, and provide a better user experience.
